# DevOps Take-Home Challenge

## Objective

To assess your skills in continuous integration, continuous deployment, and infrastructure as code, you will complete the following tasks.
You will deploy this small web application using a CI/CD pipeline, and manage the infrastructure using Terraform.

## Overview

You will use Docker to containerize the application, set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, and manage the infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.

## Tasks

1. **Containerization**

   - Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
   - Ensure the application runs correctly inside the container.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**

   - Set up a GitHub repository for your application.
   - Configure GitHub Actions to:
     - Automatically build the Docker image upon each commit.
     - Run a basic lint check or unit test.

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

   - Use Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure on AWS:
     - An EC2 instance to host your application.
     - Security group to allow necessary traffic (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
   - Ensure the Terraform scripts are modular and reusable.

4. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
   - Extend the GitHub Actions workflow to:
     - Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
     - Deploy the application to the EC2 instance using the Docker image.

## Deliverables

1. **Code Repository:**

   - A fork of this GitHub repository with:
     - The source code of application.
     - The Dockerfile.
     - GitHub Actions workflows.
     - Terraform scripts.

2. **Documentation:**
   - A README.md file explaining:
     - How to build and run the application locally.
     - How to set up the infrastructure using Terraform.
     - How to deploy the application using the CI/CD pipeline.
